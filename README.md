# SwitchCardGame
Java implementation

You are going to build a small card game called SWITCH using expendable array and linked list. You will
be given two abstract classes – Card and Board, from which you will implement the game specific
classes – CardSwitch and BoardSwitch. You will also implement an array list-like data structure
that keeps track of the cards in a player’s hand. This is the Hand class, used to represent a Player and a
Deck. The Board class maintains a linked list-like data structure that keeps track of all players in the
game and decides the winner of the game.
